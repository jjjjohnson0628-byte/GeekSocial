- Skip: media/, temp/, old data
- Result: 50-100MB ZIP file
```

**Data Migration**: If you want to share posts/users
```
- Include data/users.json and data/posts.json
- Recipients will see your posts/users when they extract
```

**Read-Only Sharing**: For demos
```
- Don't include data/ folder
- Fresh start for each person who runs it
```

## 🤔 COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: Can they modify the app?**
A: Yes, it's open source! SocialApp.java has all the source.

**Q: Will their data sync with mine?**
A: No, each computer has separate data. To share: manually copy data/users.json and data/posts.json

**Q: What if they find a bug?**
A: You can both edit SocialApp.java and rebuild! Run Build.bat to compile.

**Q: Can they run it on their phone?**
A: Not yet. Java/JavaFX isn't typical on mobile. Android/iOS version would need rewrite.
