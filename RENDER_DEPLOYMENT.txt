=====================================
DEPLOYMENT GUIDE: RENDER.COM
=====================================

Render is the best free option for deploying your SocialAppServer!

FEATURES:
- Free tier: 750 hours/month (can run continuously or part-time)
- Auto scaling
- Free SSL/HTTPS
- Easy deployment from GitHub

PREREQUISITES:
1. GitHub account (free)
2. Render account (free at render.com)
3. SocialAppServer code in a GitHub repository

STEP 1: PREPARE YOUR REPO
========================

Your GitHub repo should have structure:
```
SocialApp/
├── SocialAppServer.java
├── NetworkClient.java
├── Procfile              (created for you)
├── Dockerfile            (created for you)
├── lib/                  (all JAR dependencies)
│   ├── gson-2.x.jar
│   └── ... other JARs ...
└── data/                 (will be created at runtime)
```

IMPORTANT: Make sure all JAR libraries are in the lib/ folder!


STEP 2: CREATE GITHUB REPOSITORY
================================

1. Go to github.com and create a new public repo called "SocialApp"
2. Clone it locally (or upload these files):
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SocialApp.git
   cd SocialApp
   
3. Copy all your files:
   - SocialAppServer.java
   - Procfile
   - Dockerfile
   - lib/ folder (with all JARs)
   
4. Push to GitHub:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial SocialApp server"
   git push origin main


STEP 3: DEPLOY ON RENDER
=======================

1. Go to render.com and sign up (free)

2. Click "New +" → Select "Docker"

3. Fill in deployment form:
   Name:               socialapp-server
   GitHub Repo:        https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SocialApp
   Root Directory:     .
   Build Command:      (leave empty - Dockerfile handles it)
   Start Command:      (leave empty - Dockerfile handles it)
   
4. Environment Variables (Add these):
   PORT               8080 (Render sets this automatically)
   HOST               0.0.0.0 (already set in code)

5. Click "Deploy"

6. Wait 3-5 minutes for deployment to complete


STEP 4: UPDATE YOUR CLIENT
==========================

Once deployment succeeds, Render will give you a URL like:
   https://socialapp-server-abc123.onrender.com

In PowerShell, set the environment variable:
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("SOCIAL_APP_SERVER", "https://socialapp-server-abc123.onrender.com", "User")

Then restart PowerShell and run:
   java -cp . SocialApp


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

❌ "Build failed"
→ Check that all JAR files are in lib/ folder
→ Check Dockerfile and Procfile are in root directory

❌ "Application failed to start"
→ Check logs in Render dashboard
→ Verify PORT environment variable is being read

❌ "Connection refused from client"
→ Make sure SOCIAL_APP_SERVER is set correctly
→ Check HTTPS not HTTP (Render uses HTTPS only)

✓ "Free tier hours running out?"
→ Free tier = 750 hours/month = ~25 hours/day
→ Or keep it running 24/7 × 31 days = uses all 744 hours
→ Upgrade to paid if you need 100% uptime


AUTO-REDEPLOYMENT
=================

After initial setup:
- Every git push auto-redeploys
- No manual steps needed!
- Changes go live in 1-2 minutes

To redeploy a new version:
   git push origin main  (Render auto-deploys)


MONITORING
==========

In Render Dashboard:
- View logs in real-time
- See deployment history
- Monitor resource usage
- Set up alerts


UPGRADING FROM FREE
===================

When you outgrow free tier ($7/month):
- Render Dashboard → Settings → Upgrade
- Paid tier = 24/7 uptime guarantee
- Better performance, more memory


QUESTIONS?
==========

1. Is my data persistent?
   → Data in /data folder is ephemeral (lost on redeploy)
   → Solution: Use database (PostgreSQL add-on for $7/month)

2. Can I scale?
   → Yes! Render has built-in auto-scaling

3. SSL/HTTPS?
   → Free automatic SSL certificate included!

4. Custom domain?
   → Yes! Add custom domain in Render settings ($12/year)


NEXT: Database Setup (Optional)
================================

To persist data across redeployments, add PostgreSQL:
1. In Render Dashboard → Create PostgreSQL
2. Update SocialAppServer to use JDBC
3. Set DATABASE_URL environment variable

(Can implement if needed - let me know!)
